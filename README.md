In this repo, I'm experimenting with building and training a custom text-to-video model. It's still a work in progress, and there's a lot more to be done. So far, I've only trained the DIT model.

Apologies for the lack of proper documentation I'm not putting much time into it right now since writing docs feels a bit boring to me.
